<h1>Argel Ambulo</h1>
</section>
<p>My name is Argel Ambulo. I am from fresno california and moved here to Los Angeles last year for my senior year. I love playing sports and learning about different things. I have always been a sports guy and have always been playing sports, working out, and being active. Sports is what comforts me when I need comfort. I am 18 years old and have always wanted to learn about coding so I thought this class would be perfect for me, since I also build websites for people this class will help a lot. Im very quiet but can be talkative around the people that I know. I have 2 dogs named Hazel and Shay, Hazel lives with me and Shay lives with my sister in Fresno. I live with my dad here in L.A, my sister lives in Fresno, my mom lives in Porter Ranch, and my brother lives in Chicago. I am the youngest in the family. My brother also just had twins so I am now a uncle!</p>
